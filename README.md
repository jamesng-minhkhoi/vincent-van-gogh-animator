## Bringing Paintings to Life

This project explores the animation of brushstrokes in static paintings, revealing the inherent movement and energy captured within the artist's technique. By analyzing directional patterns in the artwork, our algorithm creates subtle, flowing animations that respect the original composition while adding a new dimension of visual experience.

Each painting responds differently to the animation process, with the resulting movement directly reflecting the artist's brushwork patterns and techniques. This creates a unique visual dialogue between traditional art forms and computational interpretation.

## Van Gogh Collection

### Starry Night

The swirling brushstrokes in Van Gogh's iconic "Starry Night" create natural flow patterns that produce a mesmerizing animation effect. The algorithm effectively captures the circular motion in the sky and transforms it into dynamic movement.

### Starry Night Over the Rhone

Another variation of Van Gogh's night sky work, where the reflections on water create an additional dimension of movement. Note how the algorithm detects and animates both the sky patterns and their reflections in the water.

### Wheatfield with Crows

The dramatic brushwork in this painting creates bold movement patterns. The algorithm captures the sweeping strokes in the wheat field and the dynamic energy in the sky.

### Wheatfield with Cypresses

The undulating cypress trees and wheat field in this painting lend themselves perfectly to animation. The algorithm highlights Van Gogh's characteristic swirling brushstrokes, bringing movement to both the trees and field.

### Vincent Portrait

Even in this self-portrait, the algorithm identifies and animates the distinctive brushwork patterns, creating subtle movement that respects the subject while emphasizing Van Gogh's unique style.

### Loving Vincent

This animation captures the flowing brushwork from another Van Gogh-inspired piece, demonstrating how the algorithm works effectively across various interpretations of the artist's style.

## Technical Insights

The animations above demonstrate the effectiveness of our Gabor filter approach in detecting brushstroke directionality. Van Gogh's work is particularly well-suited for this technique due to his distinctive brushwork with clear directional strokes.

Each animation preserves the integrity of the original composition while revealing the dynamic qualities inherent in the brushwork. The perpendicular flow technique creates natural movement along the brushstrokes without distorting the overall image structure.

These results show how computational techniques can reveal new aspects of traditional artwork, creating a bridge between static and dynamic visual art forms.
